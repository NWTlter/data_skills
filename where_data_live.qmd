Niwot LTER uses the [Environmental Data Initiative](https://edirepository.org/) as its primary repository. The [EDI data porta](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp)l provides the back end for the [Niwot Ridge LTER Data Catalog](https://nwt.lternet.edu/data-catalog). Because it is a [DataOne](https://www.dataone.org/) member node, all Niwot Data can also be found by searching on [DataOne](https://search.dataone.org/data). You can access the same Niwot data from any of these endpoints; it does not matter which you use you will end up with the same data.
