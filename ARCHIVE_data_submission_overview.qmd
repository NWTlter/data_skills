## Data Policy

Niwot Ridge follows the [LTER Network Data Policy](https://lternet.edu/data-access-policy/#:~:text=The%20LTER%20data%20policy%20includes,the%20conditions%20for%20data%20use.). If you are funded by the LTER, your data must submit data, on time, to the information manager, who will work with you to get it archived.

## The Niwot Ridge Data Catalog
Niwot Ridge uses the [Environmental Data Initiative](https://edirepository.org/) as its primary archive. This also forms the backend for the [Niwot Data Catalog](https://nwt.lternet.edu/data-catalog). While we will work collaboratively on preparing your data for submission to EDI, *the Niwot Information Manager must submit the data to EDI in order for it to be included in Niwot's data catalog*. **Do NOT submit Niwot LTER data to EDI on your own or it will not appear in the Niwot catalog, and it will be extremely difficult for future NWT researcher to find.**
