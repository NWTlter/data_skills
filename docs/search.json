    "text": "Anatomy of a Data Package\nTo effectively search it is helpful to understand the anatomy of a “data package” on EDI. A single data package contains one or many thematically linked data files (aka “entities”), which are archived together with their metadata, under a single packageID, referenced by a single dataset citation, and assigned a single DOI.\nWithin EDI, data package identifiers have the form scope.accession.version, where:\n\nscope is a string value that identifies the organization, project, or theme of the data package. For Niwot Ridge datasets, the scope is always knb-lter-nwt\naccession is an integer value that uniquely identifies the data package within the namespace of the scope\nversion is an integer value in increasing order that identifies the version of the data package\n\nAn example of a packageID is knb-lter-nwt.314.3\nA DOI is a globally unique and persistent identifier that unambiguously resolves to the data package landing page. DOIs should always be used when citing a data package.\nAn example of a DOI is doi:10.6073/pasta/7890c3264eb71bb992f0237844b02667",

Often, I find that the default search returns either too many or too few datasets, and it can be frustrating to page through them all on the web. In this case, it can be more efficient to download the entire catalog as a .csv and either search the results locally after opening the spreadsheet (CTL-F), or scanning quickly for a specific dataset or datasets of interest.\n\n\n\nEDI catalog has both search and advanced search features. Narrowing the search to include only the Niwot scope (data packages beginning with knb-lter-nwt) will help reduce your search to Niwot LTER data\n\n\n\nIf you know the packageID of a dataset, you can enter that directly into the Identifier field of the EDI data catalog advanced search. Entering a packageID without a version (i.e. entering only the scope and accession, example: knb-lter-nwt.314) will lead you to the most current version.\n\n\n\nIf you know the DOI of a dataset you can enter it directly into your browser to be taken to the landing page of the dataset, all you need to do is append the doi to the url https://doi.org/ (the doi will start with 10.6073)",

You can use the ‘change type’ button to set this back to ‘text’ (even if the entire content of the column is numbers, for example for indexed values) and/or ‘categorical’ (for use when numeric codes signify particular categories).\nConversely, ezEML may miscategorize numeric columns as text when missing value codes are strings.

Note that you will need to have API access (e.g. setting up an API for Anthropic) and (often) pay a nominal fee for service. As of January 2026, both VS Code and Positron can be configured to use Github Copilot as a model provider, which provides a fairly generous free tier for academics. Applications include inline code completion, editing and agent mode as well as exploratory data analysis.\nThis is not an exhaustive list. Eclipse, JetBrains, Visual Studio, and Xcode also have integrated AI tools. If you prefer or are familiar with one of those, start there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCline code\n\n\n\n\n\nRoo code\n\n\nBoth tools are also available as command line interfaces (CLIs) if you want to use them outside of VS Code. The number of landscape of coding agents is expanding rapidly, so keep exploring.\n\n\n\n\nInclude companies that have developed the models (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) as companies that have contracts to source models from different providers (e.g. Openrouter, Copilots).\nGenerally the free tier is small to non-existent.\nPaying for access to the API is different billing system than subscribing to a higher tier of the brower-based chat service. For example, if you are already have a chatGPT plus subcription, you still need to set up and fund an API account with OpenAI to use the integrated code development features.\n\n\nCopilotOpenrouterClaudeChatGPTGemini\n\n\n\nGithub Copilot\n\nIf you’re a student or educator interested in using LLM’s for coding, this is the thing you should sign up for first. There’s also a free tier anyone can try. Students and educators get free access to Github Copilot Pro through GitHub Education. Note it can take a few days to get verified through GitHub Education, and can be a bit of a hassle but it is definitely worth it! Github Copilot supports [multiple AI models] (https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Github Copilot is NOT the same thing as Microsoft Copilot\n\n\n\nIt’s confusing, because github is now owned by Microsoft! The ‘Copilot’ that shows up on your windows machine and offers to help you with various tasks is a different (and much less useful, IMO) beast.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenrouter allows you to pay one fee to access multiple models from different providers (similar to copilot). I believe the context window is larger than with Copilot, so performance may be better. Have not tried it out.\n\n\n\n\nAnthropic’s Claude\n\nIn my experience the best at coding in R. Also surprisingly good at Google Earth Engine. The API is not free but you can sign up for $5 of tokens to try it out.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT\n\nThe classic. The API is not free though you may get some complementary tokens when you sign up.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle’s Gemini\n\nYou can try out gemini for free. The privacy is not the greatest. Apparently good at images/videos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday’s quickstart demo’s give you some idea of how to use these tools, but to learn more, check out the following resources:\n\nRStudioPositronVS Code\n\n\nThe official RStudio GitHub Copilot user’s guide is here: RStudio Copilot Guide.\nWhen enabled, grey “ghost text” will appear as you type. Accept the suggestion by pressing tab or select Enter/Return to ignore the suggestion. I often find the suggestion is 80% correct and it’s faster to accept an incorrect suggestion and then edit it to have the correct content than to do all the typing myself.\nThis youtube video demos using Github Copilot in Rstudio.\nLLM chat is also possible in R/RStudio, via the ellmer package. To use LLM chat features, you must set up an API key to access models. API keys are available from Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (ChatGPT), or Google (Gemini). Some are not free. Confusingly, an upgraded plan on ChatGPT etc that would allow you to used more advanced models through the browser does NOT cover the API tools.\nSee the ellmer documentation, slides from a short-course or this helpful youtube video for more information.

    "text": "RStudio has Github copilot for inline code completion. Add #comments right into your script and watch copilot try to write code. Works likes a multiline typeahead.\nPositron/VS code can provide access to a variety of model providers and models. Note that you will need to have API access (e.g. setting up an API for Anthropic) and (often) pay a nominal fee for service. As of January 2026, both VS Code and Positron can be configured to use Github Copilot as a model provider, which provides a fairly generous free tier for academics. Applications include inline code completion, editing and agent mode as well as exploratory data analysis.\nThis is not an exhaustive list. Eclipse, JetBrains, Visual Studio, and Xcode also have integrated AI tools. If you prefer or are familiar with one of those, start there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCline code\n\n\n\n\n\nRoo code\n\n\nBoth tools are also available as command line interfaces (CLIs) if you want to use them outside of VS Code. The number of landscape of coding agents is expanding rapidly, so keep exploring.\n\n\n\n\nInclude companies that have developed the models (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) as companies that have contracts to source models from different providers (e.g. Openrouter, Copilots).\nGenerally the free tier is small to non-existent.\nPaying for access to the API is different billing system than subscribing to a higher tier of the brower-based chat service. For example, if you are already have a chatGPT plus subcription, you still need to set up and fund an API account with OpenAI to use the integrated code development features.\n\n\nCopilotOpenrouterClaudeChatGPTGemini\n\n\n\nGithub Copilot\n\nIf you’re a student or educator interested in using LLM’s for coding, this is the thing you should sign up for first. There’s also a free tier anyone can try. Students and educators get free access to Github Copilot Pro through GitHub Education. Note it can take a few days to get verified through GitHub Education, and can be a bit of a hassle but it is definitely worth it! Github Copilot supports [multiple AI models] (https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Github Copilot is NOT the same thing as Microsoft Copilot\n\n\n\nIt’s confusing, because github is now owned by Microsoft! The ‘Copilot’ that shows up on your windows machine and offers to help you with various tasks is a different (and much less useful, IMO) beast.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenrouter allows you to pay one fee to access multiple models from different providers (similar to copilot). I believe the context window is larger than with Copilot, so performance may be better. Have not tried it out.\n\n\n\n\nAnthropic’s Claude\n\nIn my experience the best at coding in R. Also surprisingly good at Google Earth Engine. The API is not free but you can sign up for $5 of tokens to try it out.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT\n\nThe classic. The API is not free though you may get some complementary tokens when you sign up.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle’s Gemini\n\nYou can try out gemini for free. The privacy is not the greatest. Apparently good at images/videos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday’s quickstart demo’s give you some idea of how to use these tools, but to learn more, check out the following resources:\n\nRStudioPositronVS Code\n\n\nThe official RStudio GitHub Copilot user’s guide is here: RStudio Copilot Guide.\nWhen enabled, grey “ghost text” will appear as you type. Accept the suggestion by pressing tab or select Enter/Return to ignore the suggestion. I often find the suggestion is 80% correct and it’s faster to accept an incorrect suggestion and then edit it to have the correct content than to do all the typing myself.\nThis youtube video demos using Github Copilot in Rstudio.\nLLM chat is also possible in R/RStudio, via the ellmer package. To use LLM chat features, you must set up an API key to access models. API keys are available from Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (ChatGPT), or Google (Gemini). Some are not free. Confusingly, an upgraded plan on ChatGPT etc that would allow you to used more advanced models through the browser does NOT cover the API tools.\nSee the ellmer documentation, slides from a short-course or this helpful youtube video for more information.

    "text": "Danger #1 Don’t stop thinking!\nAI tools are great for implementation, but they are not going to do amazing science without a human at the helm. I think of them as a great assistant to quickly take over some tedious tasks. They make fewer typos than a person. They also sometimes completely make stuff up. If you can’t read and understand the code they generate, don’t trust it! As well, you should absolutely test/validate to make sure the code generated is doing what you think it’s doing. It is tempting to think that LLMs obviate the need to learn to code, if you aren’t fluent enough in a language to understand their suggestions and/or do not carefully check the proposed code, you risk doing some pretty terrible science. They are a tool, but you need to use it effectively and responsibly.\nSoftware engineers use unit tests (where the answer is known) to ensure their code is working as expected. While there are some cases in scientific programming where this works, often we are writing code where we do not know the expected output in advance. For example, if you are running an anova model to test for a treatment effect, you are probably(?) running that model because you do not know whether the treatment has an effect or not. If an AI model suggests a different syntax, is it to be trusted? This is a simple example that might be solved by reading the relevant help files, but for more involved workflows, one option is to use characterization tests to ensure that AI generated (or modified, for example to streamline or make more efficient) generates the same output as your initial code.\nA great tool to compare files is a checksum, which can be used to test if two files are identical.\nThe code snippet below demonstrates how you would go about this.\n\n# load libraries\nlibrary (digest)\n\n# assume your original code generated the csv \"my_output.jpg\" and you have used genAI tools to speed up your code, writing out a new file \"ai_output.jpg\" that should contain exactly the same contents.\n\nhash_original &lt;- digest(file = \"my_output.jpg\", algo = \"md5\")\nhash_improved &lt;- digest(file = \"ai_output.jpg\", algo = \"md5\")\n\n# this should return TRUE if the file has not changed\nidentical(hash_original, hash_improved)\n\nIf elements of a tabular dataset (e.g. dataframe) have changed, it is also possible to see cell-wise differences directly in R using the comparedf function from the arsenal package.\nLast, if your outputs are already tracked in git, git will show a diff the output files before and after updating codes. You can use this to inspect any differences and evaluate whether the GenAI tools have made desirable improvements or introduced errors.\n\n\nDanger #2 LLMs are confident but (often) incompetent statistical consultants\nAI tools will more often then not generate syntactically correct code that does the wrong thing. Trained to be helpful, they will rarely admit they do not know how to do something or have insufficient information. This is particularly dangerous in the realm of statistical analysis. A recent study determined that LLMs produced the correct statistical analysis 0 (complex tasks) to 88% (simple tasks) of the time (Jansen et al. 2025). Your statistical analyses should be right 100% of the time; and you should be able to explain why you chose the methods you did and understand how they were implemented.\n\n\nDanger #3 Inefficient/outdated code\nAI is trained on a lot of old internet material. If the stackoverflow solution references a function that has been deprecated, odds are your AI-generated code is going to use that. As well, the solutions can be pretty inefficient. Sometimes that may not matter - for a one-off analysis it’s probably better to spend 5 minutes writing code and let your computer churn away for an hour than write code for an hour that runs in 5 minutes. You can also ask your AI pair programmer to rewrite the code using a different syntax, rewrite more efficiently, or provide the errors/warnings back to the chat and ask for the code to be fixed based on that feedback. Iteration can help here, as can asking a different LLM to check the work of the first. But sometimes it really is more efficient to just do it yourself using the exact packages you prefer and leading to a set of code that is easiest for you to maintain and further refine. In sum, be aware that you may feel like AI is speeding up your coding when it’s actually slowing you down (Becker et al. 2025).\n\n\nDanger #4 AI agents doing something nefarious on your computer\nAI chat models can be enabled to run code on your computer if you provide it with tools. This can be advantageous as you can get your agent to do work for you! But also dangerous, e.g. if you enable your agent to delete or modify files on your computer, download viruses from the interwebs, create a bot that writes angry emails to your advisor on your behalf etc, you will experience REGRET. Using a version control system (e.g. github) is a partial antidote to make sure that you can undo any code modifications that your AI pair programmer implements that break things in your code, but cannot prevent all disasters. Do not install vs code extensions, workspaces, or run code blindly that you find on the internet. vscode has some advice on this. Be particularly cautious with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, which specify what code can be run on your computer.\nThe lethal trifecta consists of agents that can (1) access private data; (2) have potential exposure to untrusted content (e.g. unvetted places on the internet); and(3) can externally communicate (e.g. send data back to an attacker), which make them vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. Prompt injection attacks are a way for bad actors to trick AI models into doing things they shouldn’t. For example, if an AI agent is given access to private data and can communicate externally, a bad actor could craft a prompt that tricks the agent into sending sensitive information to an external server. Yes, the same bad actors that are busy e-mailing/texting/phoning you to try to get you to provide them with your credit card, mother’s maiden name, and social security number or install a virus on your computer are wasting no time in getting AI to act on their behalf. Don’t help them out here.",

The agent/edit modes of ‘chat’ (VS Code) or Positron Assistant interact directly with your files, offering code suggestions with a built-in editor that you can use to accept/reject suggestions and have them inserted right into your code. It’s a much more streamlined interface than cutting and pasting code into your browser and can do much more advanced work than typeaheads.

If you are an R user, I recommend installing Positron (and enabling Positron Assistant) and/or VS Code (together with the Copilot extensions). Note there are GenAI tools that are only available in VSCode/Positron (not RStudio) so even if you prefer one of the more RStudio for everyday coding, consider trying out Positron or VSCode for more involved GenAI tasks.\n\nRStudioPositronVS Code\n\n\nTo enable GitHub Copilot in RStudio follow the directions here (I have copied the relevant parts below)\n\nNavigate to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Copilot.\n\nCheck the box to “Enable GitHub Copilot”.\n\nDownload and install the Copilot Agent components.\n\nClick the “Sign In” button.\n\nIn the “GitHub Copilot: Sign in” dialog, copy the Verification Code.\n\nNavigate to or click on the link to https://github.com/login/device, paste the Verification Code and click “Continue”.\n\nGitHub will request the necessary permissions for GitHub Copilot.

Note Positron supports both code completion through Github Copilot (requires Copilot setup, above) as well as sidebar/inline chat. If you haven’t installed Positron, you can download it here.\n\n\nIf you haven’t installed VS Code, you can download it here. Setup instructions for copilot are here. Note to complete this step you must already registered for Github Pro and enabled Copilot.\nIf you are an R user, you’ll also want to install the R extension for VS code. Follow instructions here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s get started!\n\n\n\n\nTypeaheads are a quick and easy way to get started with AI-assisted coding. As you type, suggestions will appear inline, allowing you to accept or reject them with a simple keystroke.\nTo accept a suggestion, press Tab. To ignore it, just keep typing.\n\n\n\n\nFigure out what’s in an entire repository/workspace\nupdate the readme to explain the contents of each folder\nDocument the script that is open\n/doc\n\n\n\n\nexplain what this code is doing\nor\n/explain\nUse inline chat, highlighting the example code OR provide the entire script file as context.\n\n\n\n\n/fix\nProvide the datafile as context here.\nor highlight existing code and use the Copilot ‘Code Review’ function.\nYou can also request a code review on github. Using this method, github will (asynchronously) review your code and create a pull request for you to review and merge if you agree with the suggestions. Read more about this method here.\n\n\n\nOne application that AI excels at is converting repetitive code into functions.\nFor example you could use the plotting code we used in the Browser-based exercise and have AI turn it into a function that can be run on different datasets. A prompt to achieve this:\nusing this example code, write a function where the input data frame, x, y, color, size and title variables can be modified using function arguments\n\n\n\n\nUnit tests are an important way to ensure your functions are doing what they are supposed to be doing. AI can help you write comprehensive unit tests. You should ensure that the outputs are in fact correct, but AI can save you a lot of boring typing here in getting them set up.\nwrite unit tests for this function using testthat. Include tests for edge cases, invalid inputs, and expected outputs.\n\n\n\n\nAI isn’t great at running QC on large datasets (it doesn’t typically read in huge files). But it can help you write code to qc your own data. An example prompt might look something like this (providing the datafile as context)\nwrite R code to run quality control and visualize these data. Include checks for spelling errors, duplicates or missing data and repeating values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Databot is fully agentic, use with caution!\n\n\n\nBefore experimenting with Databot, please read the Posit blog post Databot is not a flotation device, and review the Danger Zone for important considerations when using agentic AI tools. Databot – when running unsupervised – is an example of an agent that could be vulnerable to a prompt injection attack, or delete files on your computer. Consider the potential consequences before clicking that ‘always allow’ button.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, try out Databot, Positron’s experimental tool for exploratory data analysis. Read more about Databot here and here. Databot is accessed via the Command Palette Cmd+Shift+P on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux and typing the keyword ‘Databot’.\n\nThe folks at Positron have made a nice video to demo Databot in action, that is embedded below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: Format your code as you go\n\n\n\nFix the indenting and spacing BEFORE you ask your AI agent to start editing. You can use the styler package in Rstudio and/or in VScode right click and select ‘format code’ to accomplish this. Your AI agent will fix formatting as it goes, but this dramatically increases the number of lines you need to check/accept/reject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypeaheadsChatInsert codeAccept/Reject editsReview codeLimits\n\n\nWhen enabled, grey “ghost text” will appear as you type. Accept the suggestion by pressing tab or select Enter/Return to ignore the suggestion. I often find the suggestion is 80% correct and it’s faster to accept an incorrect suggestion and then edit it to have the correct content than to do all the typing myself.\nFeatures are similar in Rstudio/VS code/Positron.

To approve these permissions, click “Authorize GitHub Copilot Plugin”.\n\nAfter the permissions have been approved, your RStudio IDE will indicate the currently signed in user.\n\nClose the Global Options dialogue, open a source file (.R, .py, .qmd, etc) and begin coding with Copilot!\n\nTo disable GitHub Copilot either:\n\nNavigate to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Copilot and uncheck “Enable GitHub Copilot”, or\n\nUse the Command Palette Cmd+Shift+P on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, search for “Enable GitHub Copilot” and then uncheck “Enable GitHub Copilot”.\n\n\n\nTo enable Positron Assistant follow the directions here. Note Positron supports both code completion through Github Copilot (requires Copilot setup, above) as well as sidebar/inline chat. If you haven’t installed Positron, you can download it here.\n\n\nIf you haven’t installed VS Code, you can download it here. Setup instructions for copilot are here. Note to complete this step you must already registered for Github Pro and enabled Copilot.\nIf you are an R user, you’ll also want to install the R extension for VS code. Follow instructions here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s get started!\n\n\n\n\nTypeaheads are a quick and easy way to get started with AI-assisted coding. As you type, suggestions will appear inline, allowing you to accept or reject them with a simple keystroke.\nTo accept a suggestion, press Tab. To ignore it, just keep typing.\n\n\n\n\nFigure out what’s in an entire repository/workspace\nupdate the readme to explain the contents of each folder\nDocument the script that is open\n/doc\n\n\n\n\nexplain what this code is doing\nor\n/explain\nUse inline chat, highlighting the example code OR provide the entire script file as context.\n\n\n\n\n/fix\nProvide the datafile as context here.\nor highlight existing code and use the Copilot ‘Code Review’ function.\nYou can also request a code review on github. Using this method, github will (asynchronously) review your code and create a pull request for you to review and merge if you agree with the suggestions. Read more about this method here.\n\n\n\nOne application that AI excels at is converting repetitive code into functions.\nFor example you could use the plotting code we used in the Browser-based exercise and have AI turn it into a function that can be run on different datasets. A prompt to achieve this:\nusing this example code, write a function where the input data frame, x, y, color, size and title variables can be modified using function arguments\n\n\n\n\nUnit tests are an important way to ensure your functions are doing what they are supposed to be doing. AI can help you write comprehensive unit tests. You should ensure that the outputs are in fact correct, but AI can save you a lot of boring typing here in getting them set up.\nwrite unit tests for this function using testthat. Include tests for edge cases, invalid inputs, and expected outputs.\n\n\n\n\nAI isn’t great at running QC on large datasets (it doesn’t typically read in huge files). But it can help you write code to qc your own data. An example prompt might look something like this (providing the datafile as context)\nwrite R code to run quality control and visualize these data. Include checks for spelling errors, duplicates or missing data and repeating values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Databot is fully agentic, use with caution!\n\n\n\nBefore experimenting with Databot, please read the Posit blog post Databot is not a flotation device, and review the Danger Zone for important considerations when using agentic AI tools. Databot – when running unsupervised – is an example of an agent that could be vulnerable to a prompt injection attack, or delete files on your computer. Consider the potential consequences before clicking that ‘always allow’ button.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, try out Databot, Positron’s experimental tool for exploratory data analysis. Read more about Databot here and here. Databot is accessed via the Command Palette Cmd+Shift+P on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux and typing the keyword ‘Databot’.\n\nThe folks at Positron have made a nice video to demo Databot in action, that is embedded below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: Format your code as you go\n\n\n\nFix the indenting and spacing BEFORE you ask your AI agent to start editing. You can use the styler package in Rstudio and/or in VScode right click and select ‘format code’ to accomplish this. Your AI agent will fix formatting as it goes, but this dramatically increases the number of lines you need to check/accept/reject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypeaheadsChatInsert codeAccept/Reject editsReview codeLimits\n\n\nWhen enabled, grey “ghost text” will appear as you type. Accept the suggestion by pressing tab or select Enter/Return to ignore the suggestion. I often find the suggestion is 80% correct and it’s faster to accept an incorrect suggestion and then edit it to have the correct content than to do all the typing myself.\nFeatures are similar in Rstudio/VS code/Positron. The official RStudio GitHub Copilot user’s guide is here: RStudio Copilot Guide.\nThis youtube video demos using Github Copilot in Rstudio.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen chat is located in the upper right of your screen in VS Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode generated by chat can be inserted into your code directly from the chat window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach code suggestion can be individually kept or discarded. Red lines with a are deletions, green lines are additions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvoking a review of your code from copilot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee how close you are to your monthly token limits. This feature seems to be limited to VS Code as of today; I expect it will be introduced into Positron soon",

The agent/edit modes of ‘chat’ (VS Code) or Positron Assistant interact directly with your files, offering code suggestions with a built-in editor that you can use to accept/reject suggestions and have them inserted right into your code. It’s a much more streamlined interface than cutting and pasting code into your browser and can do much more advanced work than typeaheads. As well, the LLMs can use files in your project as context to inform their suggestions.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are affiliated with an academic institution, sign up for free Github Copilot Pro through GitHub Education as a student or educator. It can be a hassle and often takes a couple of tries to get them to accept your verification documentation, but is well worth the effort. Github Copilot will allow you to try out a variety of models (albeit with a somewhat smaller context window than some other providers, which may give you lower quality results).\n\n\n\n\n\nTo conserve tokens start with the free tier models and work your way up to more expensive models if things aren’t working. There is a blog that fairly regularly does a bake-off, so check back there if you want the most current recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have signed up for one (or more) of the accounts above, you then have to figure out how to get your computer to know that, not just you.

Databot – when running unsupervised – is an example of an agent that could be vulnerable to a prompt injection attack, or delete files on your computer. Consider the potential consequences before clicking that ‘always allow’ button.\n\n\n\n\nAI isn’t great at running QC on large datasets (it doesn’t typically read in huge files). But it can help you write code to qc your own data. An example prompt might look something like this (providing the datafile as context)\nwrite R code to run quality control and visualize these data. Include checks for spelling errors, duplicates or missing data and repeating values.\nAlternatively, try out Databot, Positron’s experimental tool for exploratory data analysis. Read more about Databot here and here. Databot is accessed via the Command Palette Cmd+Shift+P on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux and typing the keyword ‘Databot’.\n\nThe folks at Positron have made a nice video to demo Databot in action, that is embedded below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: Format your code as you go\n\n\n\nFix the indenting and spacing BEFORE you ask your AI agent to start editing. You can use the styler package in Rstudio and/or in VScode right click and select ‘format code’ to accomplish this. Your AI agent will fix formatting as it goes, but this dramatically increases the number of lines you need to check/accept/reject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypeaheadsChatInsert codeAccept/Reject editsReview codeLimits\n\n\nWhen enabled, grey “ghost text” will appear as you type. Accept the suggestion by pressing tab or select Enter/Return to ignore the suggestion. I often find the suggestion is 80% correct and it’s faster to accept an incorrect suggestion and then edit it to have the correct content than to do all the typing myself.\nFeatures are similar in Rstudio/VS code/Positron.

Exemplar IDEs, AI assistants, model providers and LLMs are provided in the bottom row.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo jump right in, we’ll showcase just a few tools, but see the full instructions for more information on the different options available.\n\n\n\nIf you are an R user, I recommend starting with RStudio and experimenting with typeaheads.\nIf you want to do more complicated code modifications than simple figure tweaks, I highly recommend you use Positron/ VS Code. The agent/edit modes of ‘chat’ (VS Code) or Positron Assistant interact directly with your files, offering code suggestions with a built-in editor that you can use to accept/reject suggestions and have them inserted right into your code. It’s a much more streamlined interface than cutting and pasting code into your browser and can do much more advanced work than typeaheads. As well, the LLMs can use files in your project as context to inform their suggestions.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are affiliated with an academic institution, sign up for free Github Copilot Pro through GitHub Education as a student or educator. It can be a hassle and often takes a couple of tries to get them to accept your verification documentation, but is well worth the effort. Github Copilot will allow you to try out a variety of models (albeit with a somewhat smaller context window than some other providers, which may give you lower quality results).\n\n\n\n\n\nTo conserve tokens start with the free tier models and work your way up to more expensive models if things aren’t working. There is a blog that fairly regularly does a bake-off, so check back there if you want the most current recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have signed up for one (or more) of the accounts above, you then have to figure out how to get your computer to know that, not just you. If you are an R user, I recommend installing Positron (and enabling Positron Assistant) and/or VS Code (together with the Copilot extensions). Note there are GenAI tools that are only available in VSCode/Positron (not RStudio) so even if you prefer one of the more RStudio for everyday coding, consider trying out Positron or VSCode for more involved GenAI tasks.\n\nRStudioPositronVS Code\n\n\nTo enable GitHub Copilot in RStudio follow the directions here (I have copied the relevant parts below)\n\nNavigate to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Copilot.\n\nCheck the box to “Enable GitHub Copilot”.\n\nDownload and install the Copilot Agent components.\n\nClick the “Sign In” button.\n\nIn the “GitHub Copilot: Sign in” dialog, copy the Verification Code.\n\nNavigate to or click on the link to https://github.com/login/device, paste the Verification Code and click “Continue”.\n\nGitHub will request the necessary permissions for GitHub Copilot. To approve these permissions, click “Authorize GitHub Copilot Plugin”.\n\nAfter the permissions have been approved, your RStudio IDE will indicate the currently signed in user.\n\nClose the Global Options dialogue, open a source file (.R, .py, .qmd, etc) and begin coding with Copilot!\n\nTo disable GitHub Copilot either:\n\nNavigate to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Copilot and uncheck “Enable GitHub Copilot”, or\n\nUse the Command Palette Cmd+Shift+P on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, search for “Enable GitHub Copilot” and then uncheck “Enable GitHub Copilot”.\n\n\n\nTo enable Positron Assistant follow the directions here. Note Positron supports both code completion through Github Copilot (requires Copilot setup, above) as well as sidebar/inline chat. If you haven’t installed Positron, you can download it here.\n\n\nIf you haven’t installed VS Code, you can download it here. Setup instructions for copilot are here.
