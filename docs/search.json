    "text": "Clean your data\n\nIt is best to publish data in a minimally processed form that preserves the original measurements. Any alteration of the values and associated rational should be clearly described in the methods section of the data package metadata.\nBefore publishing, please conduct basic quality control checks, such as checking for duplicates, spelling errors, and values out of range. Where it is clear that the error is from transcription (for example copying the same data twice from field notebooks, or data are misspelled), please rectify these data before publishing.\nFor tips on data quality control using R, see the tutorial here.\nIf you discover out of range that is not simply a transcription error, consider flagging problematic data instead of removing.\n\nFormat your data\n\nUse long rather than wide formats. This facilitates tacking on another year or location of the same data without widening your data tables and remaking the metadata, and is also much easier to analyze.\nUse non proprietary tabular data (comma or tab delimited ASCII text) and geospatial data types. Do NOT use excel for published data.\nAvoid using white space or special characters in column names\nUse consistent missing value codes (i.e. do not use NA in some rows and N/A in others)\nUse UTF-8 encoding if your data includes special characters\nIf you need help achieving the above, contact the IM.\n\nFollow Niwot Ridge naming conventions for each entity\n\nAll Niwot Ridge data follow the convention &lt;short_description&gt;.&lt;author first initial last initial&gt;.data.&lt;extension&gt;. For example if Nancy Emery submitted a file on Geum demography, it might be entitled geum_demog.ne.data.csv",

A single data package contains one or many thematically linked data files (aka “entities”), which are archived together with their metadata, under a single packageID, referenced by a single dataset citation, and assigned a single DOI.\nWithin EDI, data package identifiers have the form scope.accession.version, where:\n\nscope is a string value that identifies the organization, project, or theme of the data package. For Niwot Ridge datasets, the scope is always knb-lter-nwt\naccession is an integer value that uniquely identifies the data package within the namespace of the scope\nversion is an integer value in increasing order that identifies the version of the data package\n\nAn example of a packageID is knb-lter-nwt.314.3\nA DOI is a globally unique and persistent identifier that unambiguously resolves to the data package landing page. DOIs should always be used when citing a data package.\nAn example of a DOI is doi:10.6073/pasta/7890c3264eb71bb992f0237844b02667",

Often, I find that the default search returns either too many or too few datasets, and it can be frustrating to page through them all on the web. In this case, it can be more efficient to download the entire catalog as a .csv and either search the results locally after opening the spreadsheet (CTL-F), or scanning quickly for a specific dataset or datasets of interest.\n\n\n\nEDI catalog has both search and advanced search features. Narrowing the search to include only the Niwot scope (data packages beginning with knb-lter-nwt) will help reduce your search to Niwot LTER data\n\n\n\nIf you know the packageID of a dataset, you can enter that directly into the Identifier field of the EDI data catalog advanced search. Entering a packageID without a version (i.e. entering only the scope and accession, example: knb-lter-nwt.314) will lead you to the most current version.\n\n\n\nIf you know the DOI of a dataset you can enter it directly into your browser to be taken to the landing page of the dataset, all you need to do is append the doi to the url https://doi.org/ (the doi will start with 10.6073)",

However the landing page of each dataset on EDI has the salient parts displayed in an easy-to-read format. Toggling the View Full Metadata/View Summary button will display/collapse details.\n.\nWhile we recommend you read all the metadata, below we highlight some areas some users have reported difficult finding.\n\n\nCitationUnitsPeopleMethods\n\n\nAny time you download a dataset you will want to make note of the suggested dataset citation, so you can track what you are using and credit the authors appropriately. EDI provides a handy button to do just this. \n\n\nVariable definitions and units can be found under Data Entities in the section Table Column Descriptions. This section will also tell you what any abbreviations mean.\n\n\n\nCreators are the main individuals who initiated or maintained a dataset and are listed as authors in the suggested dataset citation. Where possible, we have also been adding the names of techs (they will display on EDI as ‘associate’, downloading the full EML also allows you to see their full roles). Consider adding key data contributors to you authorship or acknowledgements section as appropriate.\n\n\n\nRead the methods! They contain critical information about how the data were collected, known issues and other information that will help guide your analyses. If there’s something you don’t understand, reach out to the dataset creators and/or the dataset contact and we will put you in touch with someone who can help.",
