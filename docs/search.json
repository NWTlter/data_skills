Often, I find that the default search returns either too many or too few datasets, and it can be frustrating to page through them all on the web. In this case, it can be more efficient to download the entire catalog as a .csv and either search the results locally after opening the spreadsheet (CTL-F), or scanning quickly for a specific dataset or datasets of interest.\n\n\n\nEDI catalog has both search and advanced search features. Narrowing the search to include only the Niwot scope (data packages beginning with knb-lter-nwt) will help reduce your search to Niwot LTER data\n\n\n\nIf you know the packageID of a dataset, you can enter that directly into the Identifier field of the EDI data catalog advanced search. Entering a packageID without a version (i.e. entering only the scope and accession, example: knb-lter-nwt.314) will lead you to the most current version.\n\n\n\nIf you know the DOI of a dataset you can enter it directly into your browser to be taken to the landing page of the dataset, all you need to do is append the doi (the doi will start with 10.6073)",
