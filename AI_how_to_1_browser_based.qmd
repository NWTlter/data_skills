An easy, low-effort way to get a feel for genAI tools is through browser-based interfaces. They do not require any installation or setup and do not have a steep learning curve to get started. Below is an example of using [Claude](https://claude.ai/) to modify an R script to change figure aesthetics. Tweaking figures is one of my favorite ways to use genAI tools. Results are easy to verify and I often find it's much faster than looking up documentation or searching through Stack Overflow.

### Browser based

"You are an expert R programmer. Modify the following R code to use red colors in p, blues in p1, greens in p2 and purples in p3. Use cowplot to make a multipanel figure with the title 'AI tools are pretty cool'".

##### Prompt

“You are an expert R programmer. Modify the following R code to use red colors in p, blues in p1, greens in p2 and purples in p3. Use cowplot to make a multipanel figure with the title ‘AI tools are pretty cool’”.

```{r eval = FALSE}

# library

library(ggplot2)
library(ggExtra)

# The mtcars dataset is proposed in R

head(mtcars)

# classic plot :

p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg, color=cyl, size=cyl)) + geom_point() + theme(legend.position="none")

# with marginal histogram

p1 <- ggMarginal(p, type="histogram")

# marginal density

p2 <- ggMarginal(p, type="density")

# marginal boxplot

p3 <- ggMarginal(p, type="boxplot")
```

#### Activity: Try it out!

-   Select an AI interface to further modify your plot. You can use any of the following: [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com//), [Claude](https://claude.ai/), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), or another of your choosing. You will probably need to sign up for an account if you haven't already.

-   Use a prompt such as: "You are an expert R programmer. Modify the following R code to {use your imagination here}. Copy the R code from the "Prompt" window above, and paste it into the chat window.

-   Inspect the results and if they seem reasonable, copy and paste the generated code back into your R session and run it.

How did it work?

Congratulations, you are have now dipped your toes into the world of [vibe coding](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-vibe-coding)!
