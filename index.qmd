This guide started a quick-start summary of materials for Niwot LTER researchers on how to find, use and work with data from the [Niwot Ridge LTER Data Catalog](https://nwt.lternet.edu/data-catalog).

The Environmental Data Catalog also has extensive [resources for data users](https://edirepository.org/resources/resources-for-data-users). We thank EDI for providing the basis of much of the material here.

It has morphed into a general skills-you-might want as a Niwot Researcher, and now includes information on AI tools for your everyday life.

This is a work in progress. If you find errors in the tutorial or that there are questions you still have after working through the materials, please make a git issue [here](https://github.com/NWTlter/data_skills/issues).
