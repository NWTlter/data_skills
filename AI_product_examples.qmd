### Exploring Niwot Climate Data Trends

##### NWT-8 Renewal Prep (2022)

Original figures from the Niwot renewal prep work (pre-AI)

##### Data Dashboard (2023)

Modified code in (? an hour or two can't remember) to make nice aesthetics for the data dashboard (pre-AI)

##### NWT Symposium (2025)

Modified code in \~ an hour to update the import to read from EDI following EDI API modifications, all sites, split by season, calculate mann-kendall statistics plus Thiel-sen trends, render into multi-panel figure with embedded stats. \~391 lines of code.

### AI meeting minutes

Used claude.ai to summarize zoom meeting transcription. Committee manually reviewed, edited and augmented content, checking against notes taken during the meeting. Guess \~80% of content was generated from AI summary.

### Workshop facilitation

\~ A room full of 80+ people each stated their research priorities. chatGPT synthesize into 5 themes for breakouts and further refinement. Ideas revised and iterated by humans, but this is a useful tool for generating break-out groups real-time.

### Data Digitization

Tried a few options to get (neatly) hand-written data into spreadsheet format. [parsio](https://parsio.io/) was the winner among those I tried, but your mileage may vary. Structured format is key here; data in neat rows and columns, one value per cell, single columns contain only numbers or text not a mix of both. CHECK results carefully, they will not be perfect. But it's faster than double-key entry.

### Data QC

Have had mixed success here. Would not use AI as the *only * qc step, but it can be useful. Here's an example output when asked to find errors in a .csv of leaf trait measurements. I have had better success asking AI to *write code* to find errors in data. This has the benefit of being repeatable so you can check whether the errors are fixed.

### This presentation

Used claude.ai extensively for debugging - figures not rendering, misbehaving .css, formatting issues, inscrutable error messages.

## AI Failures

Too many to name! Some examples below:

First attempts at all coding things were filled with hallucinations, imaginary packages, functions that didn't exist and nonsense code. Syntactically correct but completely disfunctional. (this was about a year ago, things are improving fast).

Many parsio alternatives. Won't throw anyone under the bus by naming them here...

Asking chatGPT or copilot to make a pptx slide deck for me. Gemma did slightly better but still not saving me any time.

Asking chatGPT to make a cartoon illustration for a talk. No matter how much prompting I provided, we just don't share the same sense of humor. Bing maybe a tiny bit better but still not fabulous.

# Your Turn:

What have you tried? What worked, what didn't?
